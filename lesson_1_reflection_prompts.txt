How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Focusing just in the differences between the files, was a lot easy to identify
    the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In the way I will be more efficient returning to some piece of code that 
    works better

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: flexibility is the most important, cons forgot to commit and have too 
    much code in one instance

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it allows you to better recreate the snapshot of the files in the moment 
    of commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log you found the commit that you're looking for. Then with the 
    git diff you can compere with a previous version to see the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    In the way I can find the bugs between the differents commits

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try with Intro to machine learnig course!
